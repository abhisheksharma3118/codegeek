	<p>I love coding  &#9829; &#9829; &#9829;</p>
	
	<br></br>

	<p>I wanted to do something really simple and clean by using as much white space as I could get away with. This was a look I knew I wanted to avoid as I wanted to stand out as much as possible.</p>
    <p>In order for me to benefit from the site I needed to be clear about what I am offering. Being a server-side developer for the most part of my career to date I wanted to use this as an advantage.</p> 
    <p>Whilst I built the pages out to display the relative information about me and my services I began to dabble with the idea of adding some server side code to the site. I decided to build a blog engine and I did this using Python and a MYSQL backend database. In addition to this I built nested comment functionality to allow users to leave comments on individual blog pages.</p>
     <p>I did have Python coding  experience prior to this project and decided to use the language to improve my ability with it .</p>
	 
	 <br></br>
	 <p> I have worked as a freelancer ,doing some projects on backend development and data analysis.</p>
	<p>My projects have been mentioned below and its been in my blog (please do check it once .)</p>
